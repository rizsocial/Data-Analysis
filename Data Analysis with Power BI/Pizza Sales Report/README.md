### Power BI Project: Pizza Sales Analysis

[Pizza Sales Report](https://github.com/rizsocial/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Power%20BI/Pizza%20Sales%20Report/Pizza%20Sales%20Report.pbix)


In this project, I developed some very interesting insights into pizza sales for a company:
- Analyzed data to develop KPIs like total revenue (sum of all pizza orders), average order value (total revenue divided by number of orders), and total pizzas sold.
- Top 5 Best Sellers and Top 5 Worst Performers: Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
