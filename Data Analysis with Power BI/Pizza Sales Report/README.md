In this project, I uncovered several intriguing insights into the pizza sales for a company:
- Analyzed data to develop KPIs like total revenue (sum of all pizza orders), average order value (total revenue divided by number of orders), and total pizzas sold.
- Top 5 best sellers and top 5 worst performers: Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
