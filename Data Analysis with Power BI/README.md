## 1. Pizza sales analysis
In this project, I uncovered several intriguing insights into the pizza sales for a company:
- Analyzed data to develop KPIs like total revenue (sum of all pizza orders), average order value (total revenue divided by number of orders), and total pizzas sold.
- Top 5 best sellers and Top 5 worst performers: Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.

## 2. Financial data analysis
- Performed an in-depth financial data analysis to highlight key metrics including total profit, units sold, gross sales, and COGS. Analyzed profit distributions by country, product, and customer segment, and developed a matrix identifying the most and least profitable products and months, facilitating strategic decision-making.
