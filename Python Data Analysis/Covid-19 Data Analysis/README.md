## COVID-19 data analysis with Python

**Project description:**
In this project, I used Python to analyze a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset, aiming to uncover insights and correlations related to the pandemic. Key steps and findings include:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the COVID-19 dataset to ensure data accuracy.
- Visualizing data by country to highlight trends and differences in infection rates.
- Calculating the infection rate to understand the spread of the virus.
- Joining two datasets to enrich the analysis with additional information.
- Studying correlations between COVID-19 metrics and other factors such as GDP, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices.
