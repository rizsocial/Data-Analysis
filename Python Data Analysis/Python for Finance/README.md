## Expected return and risk analysis using CAPM

**Project Description:**
In this project, I used Python to calculate the expected return and risk of different securities using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Key steps and findings include:

- Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries for data analysis.
- Calculated daily returns for various stocks to analyze performance.
- Computed beta for different stocks to assess their market risk.
- Visualized the results to provide clear insights into expected returns and risks.
